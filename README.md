# Project: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

## Project: Data Modeling with Cassandra

To create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions, and wish to bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database for this analysis. we will be able to test database by running queries given to us by the analytics team from Sparkify to create the results.

## Project Overview
In this project, we will create on data modeling with Apache Cassandra and complete an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, we will need to model our own  data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries. we are provided with part of the ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.

We have provided you with a project template that takes care of all the imports and provides a structure for ETL pipeline we woul'd need to process this data.
